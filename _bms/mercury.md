# Mercury (Hg)

## Overview

Mercury is a toxic heavy metal with no known biological function in humans. Exposure occurs primarily through seafood consumption (methylmercury) and dental amalgams (elemental mercury). Monitoring mercury levels is important for neurological and cardiovascular health.

## Biomarker Details

- **Chemical symbol**: Hg
- **Test types**: 
  - Blood mercury (recent exposure, ~90 days)
  - Hair mercury (longer-term exposure, months)
  - Urine mercury (primarily for elemental/inorganic mercury)
- **Primary form in diet**: Methylmercury (organic form)

## Reference Ranges

### Blood Mercury

| Level | μg/L | Interpretation |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Low Risk | <5.8 | Minimal exposure |
| Moderate | 5.8-10 | Some fish consumption; generally safe |
| Elevated | 10-20 | Reduce high-mercury fish intake |
| High | >20 | Medical consultation recommended |

**EPA Reference Dose**: 5.8 μg/L corresponds to daily intake considered safe for most people

### Hair Mercury

| Level | μg/g | Interpretation |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Low | <1.0 | Minimal exposure |
| Moderate | 1.0-5.0 | Regular fish consumption |
| Elevated | 5.0-10 | Consider reducing fish intake |
| High | >10 | Significant exposure; reduce sources |

## Sources of Exposure

**Dietary (methylmercury)**:
- Large predatory fish (shark, swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish)
- Tuna (especially bigeye, ahi)
- Moderate: albacore tuna, sea bass, halibut
- Lower: salmon, sardines, anchovies, trout

**Environmental**:
- Dental amalgams (elemental mercury vapor)
- Occupational exposure (mining, manufacturing)
- Contaminated water or soil
- Some traditional medicines

**Historical**:
- Broken thermometers or fluorescent bulbs (elemental)

## Health Effects

### Neurological
- Cognitive impairment (memory, attention)
- Tremors and coordination problems
- Peripheral neuropathy
- Developmental effects (fetuses and children most vulnerable)

### Cardiovascular
- Potential increased risk of heart disease
- May interfere with omega-3 benefits from fish
- Oxidative stress

### Other Systems
- Kidney damage (high exposure)
- Immune system effects
- Endocrine disruption

## Populations at Higher Risk

- **Pregnant women**: Fetal brain development most vulnerable
- **Young children**: Developing nervous systems
- **High fish consumers**: Subsistence fishers, certain cultures
- **Dental professionals**: Amalgam handling

## Managing Mercury Levels

### If Elevated (>10 μg/L blood)

**Reduce exposure**:
1. Limit high-mercury fish to once/month or avoid
2. Choose low-mercury seafood (salmon, sardines, shrimp)
3. Discuss dental amalgam concerns with dentist
4. Identify occupational or environmental sources

**Support detoxification**:
- Adequate selenium (may protect against mercury toxicity)
- Antioxidants (vitamin E, C)
- Sulfur-containing foods (cruciferous vegetables, garlic)
- Adequate hydration

**Retest**: 3-6 months after reducing exposure

### If Normal (<5.8 μg/L)

**Maintain low exposure**:
- Follow fish consumption guidelines
- Choose smaller, younger fish
- Vary seafood choices
- Balance omega-3 benefits with mercury risk

## Mercury vs. Omega-3 Balance

Fish provides beneficial omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA), but some fish are high in mercury. Choose wisely:

**Best choices** (high omega-3, low mercury):
- Wild salmon
- Sardines
- Anchovies
- Herring
- Rainbow trout

**Good choices** (moderate):
- Canned light tuna
- Pollock
- Catfish

**Avoid or limit**:
- Shark, swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish
- Bigeye tuna

## Biomarker Interactions

- **Selenium**: May offer protective effects against mercury toxicity
- **Omega-3 fatty acids**: Fish high in both mercury and omega-3s create benefit/risk trade-off
- **Glutathione**: Antioxidant important for mercury metabolism

4. **Reference dose**: EPA. Mercury Study Report to Congress. EPA-452/R-97-003. 1997.

## Guidelines

- **FDA/EPA**: Pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children should avoid high-mercury fish
- **WHO**: Provisional tolerable weekly intake of 1.6 μg/kg body weight for methylmercury
- **EPA**: Reference dose of 0.1 μg/kg/day
