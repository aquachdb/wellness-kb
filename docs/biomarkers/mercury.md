# Mercury

## Overview

Mercury is a toxic heavy metal that can accumulate in the body over time. It exists in several forms, with methylmercury and inorganic mercury being the most clinically relevant for human health assessment.

## Biomarkers for Mercury Assessment

### Blood Mercury
**What It Measures**: Recent mercury exposure (past 2-3 months)
- **Primarily reflects**: Methylmercury from fish consumption
- **Half-life**: Approximately 70 days
- **Best for**: Assessing recent dietary mercury exposure

### Hair Mercury
**What It Measures**: Integrated mercury exposure over 2-3 months
- **Growth rate**: ~1 cm per month
- **Reflects**: Methylmercury exposure from diet
- **Advantages**: Non-invasive, stable, represents longer exposure period

### Urine Mercury
**What It Measures**: Primarily inorganic mercury exposure
- **Sources**: Dental amalgams, occupational exposure, some medications
- **Less useful for**: Methylmercury assessment
- **Best for**: Inorganic mercury and occupational monitoring

## Reference Levels and Safety Thresholds

### Blood Mercury
| Category | Level (μg/L) | Level (ppb) | Health Status |
|----------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Optimal** | <5.0 | <5.0 | Minimal exposure |
| **Low Concern** | 5.0-10.0 | 5.0-10.0 | Acceptable for most |
| **Moderate Concern** | 10.0-20.0 | 10.0-20.0 | Reduce exposure sources |
| **High Concern** | 20.0-50.0 | 20.0-50.0 | Significant exposure |
| **Toxic** | >50.0 | >50.0 | Medical intervention needed |

*Note: EPA reference dose corresponds to ~5.8 μg/L blood mercury*

### Hair Mercury
| Category | Level (μg/g) | Level (ppm) | Interpretation |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Low** | <1.0 | <1.0 | Minimal dietary exposure |
| **Moderate** | 1.0-2.0 | 1.0-2.0 | Typical fish consumer |
| **Elevated** | 2.0-5.0 | 2.0-5.0 | High fish consumption |
| **Concerning** | 5.0-10.0 | 5.0-10.0 | Excessive exposure |
| **Toxic** | >10.0 | >10.0 | Health risk threshold |

## Sources of Mercury Exposure

- Lobster, crab

**Low Mercury Fish** (<0.1 ppm)
- Salmon, sardines, anchovies
- Tilapia, cod, catfish
- Shrimp, scallops, clams

### Environmental Sources
**Inorganic Mercury**
- Dental amalgam fillings
- Broken thermometers/fluorescent bulbs
- Industrial emissions
- Coal burning
- Contaminated water sources

**Occupational Exposure**
- Dental professionals
- Mining workers
- Chemical industry workers
- Thermometer manufacturing

## Health Effects of Mercury Toxicity

### Neurological Effects
**Central Nervous System**
- Memory impairment
- Cognitive dysfunction
- Mood changes and irritability
- Sleep disturbances
- Tremors and coordination problems

**Peripheral Nervous System**
- Numbness and tingling
- Muscle weakness
- Reduced sensation

### Cardiovascular Effects
- Increased blood pressure
- Endothelial dysfunction
- Increased cardiovascular disease risk
- Arrhythmias at high exposures

### Immune System
- Autoimmune reactions
- Reduced immune function
- Increased infection susceptibility

### Reproductive Health
- Fertility impacts
- Pregnancy complications
- Developmental delays in children
- Low birth weight

### Kidney Effects
- Proteinuria
- Reduced kidney function
- Acute kidney injury (high exposures)

## Special Populations at Risk

### Pregnant Women and Children
- **Fetal Development**: Mercury crosses placental barrier
- **Neurodevelopment**: Critical impact on developing brain
- **Recommendations**: Stricter limits, avoid high-mercury fish
- **Target Level**: <3.5 μg/L blood mercury during pregnancy

### Frequent Fish Consumers
- **Subsistence fishers**: Higher exposure risk
- **Cultural dietary patterns**: Traditional high-fish diets
- **Athletes**: High-protein fish-based diets
- **Health-conscious individuals**: Believing "more fish is better"

### Occupational Groups
- **Dental workers**: Amalgam exposure
- **Industrial workers**: Chemical processing
- **Miners**: Mercury extraction areas
- **Healthcare workers**: Medical device exposure

## Testing Considerations

### When to Test
- Baseline assessment for high-risk individuals
- Symptoms suggestive of mercury toxicity
- High fish consumption (>2-3 servings/week)
- Occupational exposure concerns
- Pregnancy planning or during pregnancy

### Interpretation Factors
**Blood Mercury**
- Recent fish consumption affects levels
- Type of fish consumed matters
- Timing of last fish meal
- Individual metabolism differences

**Hair Mercury**
- Hair treatments may affect results
- Growth rate variations
- Collection site consistency
- Storage and handling requirements

## Reduction Strategies

### Dietary Modifications
**Smart Fish Consumption**
- Choose low-mercury fish varieties
- Limit high-mercury fish to 1 serving/month
- Vary fish types to reduce cumulative exposure
- Focus on smaller, younger fish

**Mercury-Safe Fish Recommendations**
- **2-3 servings/week**: Salmon, sardines, anchovies
- **1 serving/week**: Albacore tuna, mahi-mahi
- **1 serving/month**: Swordfish, shark, king mackerel
- **Avoid if pregnant**: High-mercury species

### Environmental Reduction
**Dental Considerations**
- Discuss amalgam alternatives with dentist
- Proper amalgam removal protocols if needed
- Regular dental hygiene to minimize exposure

**Home Environment**
- Proper disposal of mercury-containing items
- Avoid broken thermometer cleanup without protection
- Use HEPA filters in high-exposure areas

### Detoxification Support
**Natural Chelation Support**
- Cilantro and chlorella supplements
- Glutathione support (NAC, selenium)
- Adequate fiber for elimination
- Hydration for kidney function

**Medical Chelation** (severe cases only)
- DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid)
- DMPS (dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid)
- Under strict medical supervision
- Reserved for significant toxicity

## Monitoring and Follow-up

### Testing Frequency
**Initial Assessment**

- Identify exposure sources
- Implement reduction strategies

**Follow-up Testing**
- 3-6 months after dietary changes
- Annual monitoring for high-risk groups
- More frequent if levels were elevated

### Target Goals
- **Blood Mercury**: <5.0 μg/L for optimal health
- **Hair Mercury**: <1.0 μg/g for minimal exposure
- **Pregnancy**: <3.5 μg/L blood mercury
