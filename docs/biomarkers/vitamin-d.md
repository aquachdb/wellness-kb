# Vitamin D

## Overview

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and numerous physiological processes. It exists in two main forms: vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).

## Biomarker: 25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]

### What It Measures
25-hydroxyvitamin D is the major circulating form of vitamin D and the best indicator of vitamin D status. It represents the storage form of vitamin D in the body.

### Reference Ranges

| Status | 25(OH)D Level |
|--------|---------------|
| **Severe Deficiency** | <10 ng/mL (<25 nmol/L) |
| **Deficiency** | 10-19 ng/mL (25-49 nmol/L) |
| **Insufficiency** | 20-29 ng/mL (50-74 nmol/L) |
| **Sufficiency** | 30-100 ng/mL (75-250 nmol/L) |
| **Potential Toxicity** | >100 ng/mL (>250 nmol/L) |

*Note: Reference ranges may vary between laboratories and guidelines*

### Optimal Levels for Wellness
- **General Health**: 30-50 ng/mL (75-125 nmol/L)
- **Bone Health**: ≥30 ng/mL (≥75 nmol/L)
- **Immune Function**: 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L)
- **Cardiovascular Health**: 30-50 ng/mL (75-125 nmol/L)

## Factors Affecting Vitamin D Levels

### Increasing Factors
- **Sun Exposure**: UVB radiation synthesizes vitamin D3 in skin
- **Dietary Sources**: Fatty fish, fortified foods, supplements
- **Geographic Location**: Lower latitude (closer to equator)
- **Skin Pigmentation**: Lighter skin synthesizes vitamin D more efficiently
- **Age**: Younger individuals typically have better synthesis
- **Body Weight**: Normal BMI associated with better vitamin D status

### Decreasing Factors
- **Limited Sun Exposure**: Indoor lifestyle, protective clothing, sunscreen
- **Geographic Location**: Higher latitude, especially in winter
- **Dark Skin Pigmentation**: Melanin reduces UV penetration
- **Aging**: Decreased skin synthesis capacity
- **Obesity**: Sequestration in adipose tissue
- **Kidney/Liver Disease**: Impaired conversion to active forms
- **Certain Medications**: Glucocorticoids, anticonvulsants

## Health Implications

### Deficiency Consequences
**Bone Health**
- Rickets in children
- Osteomalacia in adults
- Increased fracture risk
- Reduced bone mineral density

**Immune System**
- Increased infection susceptibility
- Autoimmune disease risk
- Reduced vaccine effectiveness

**Cardiovascular**
- Hypertension risk
- Cardiovascular disease association
- Endothelial dysfunction

**Mental Health**
- Seasonal affective disorder
- Depression risk
- Cognitive impairment

### Optimal Levels Benefits
- Strong bones and teeth
- Enhanced immune function
- Improved mood and mental health
- Better cardiovascular health
- Reduced inflammation
- Optimal muscle function

## Testing Considerations

### When to Test
- Annual screening for most adults
- More frequent monitoring if deficient
- Seasonal testing (especially winter)
- Before starting high-dose supplementation

### Factors Affecting Results
- **Seasonal Variation**: Levels typically lower in winter/spring
- **Recent Sun Exposure**: Can temporarily elevate levels
- **Supplement Timing**: Recent high-dose intake affects results
- **Laboratory Method**: Different assays may give varying results

## Optimization Strategies

### Sun Exposure
- **Timing**: 10 AM - 3 PM when UVB is strongest
- **Duration**: 10-30 minutes depending on skin type
- **Skin Exposure**: Arms, legs, or back without sunscreen
- **Frequency**: 2-3 times per week minimum

### Dietary Sources
**Rich Natural Sources**
- Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines): 400-1000 IU per 3.5 oz
- Cod liver oil: 1360 IU per tablespoon
- Egg yolks (pasture-raised): 20-40 IU per yolk

**Fortified Foods**
- Fortified milk: 100-144 IU per 8 oz
- Fortified cereals: 40-100 IU per serving
- Fortified plant milks: 100-144 IU per 8 oz

### Supplementation
**Maintenance Doses**
- Adults: 1000-2000 IU daily
- Children: 400-1000 IU daily
- Elderly: 1000-2000 IU daily

**Correction Doses** (for deficiency)
- High-dose therapy: 5000-10000 IU daily for 8-12 weeks
- Weekly doses: 50,000 IU once weekly for 8 weeks
- Always under medical supervision

## Monitoring and Follow-up

### Repletion Protocol
1. **Initial Testing**: Establish baseline 25(OH)D level
2. **Supplementation**: Start appropriate dose based on level
3. **Retest**: Check levels after 8-12 weeks of supplementation
4. **Adjust**: Modify dose based on response
5. **Maintenance**: Ongoing supplementation to maintain optimal levels

### Target Levels
- **Therapeutic Goal**: Achieve and maintain 30-50 ng/mL
- **Individual Optimization**: Some may benefit from 40-60 ng/mL
- **Safety Monitoring**: Avoid sustained levels >100 ng/mL

## Special Populations

### Higher Risk Groups
- **Elderly**: Reduced synthesis, limited sun exposure
- **Dark-skinned individuals**: Especially in northern climates
- **Institutionalized**: Limited outdoor access
- **Pregnant/lactating women**: Increased requirements
- **Malabsorption disorders**: Celiac, Crohn's disease
- **Obese individuals**: Sequestration in adipose tissue

### Athletic Performance
- Optimal levels (>30 ng/mL) associated with:
  - Better muscle function
  - Reduced injury risk
  - Improved recovery
  - Enhanced immune function

## Related Biomarkers

- **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)**: Inversely related to vitamin D
- **Calcium**: Absorption depends on vitamin D status
- **Phosphorus**: Metabolism linked to vitamin D
- **1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D**: Active hormone form (rarely tested)

1. **25(OH)D is the gold standard** test for vitamin D status
2. **Target 30-50 ng/mL** for optimal health benefits
3. **Seasonal variation** is normal and expected
4. **Multiple strategies** needed: sun, diet, supplements
5. **Regular monitoring** ensures optimal maintenance
6. **Individual needs vary** based on multiple factors
