# Percentile

## Definition

A percentile indicates the percentage of values in a dataset that fall below a particular value. In wellness testing, percentiles show how your biomarker compares to others in a reference population.

## How to Read Percentiles

**50th percentile** = Median (exactly half above, half below)

**75th percentile** = Your value is higher than 75% of the reference population

**25th percentile** = Your value is higher than 25% of the reference population (or lower than 75%)

## Percentile Ranges in Reports

| Percentile | Category | Population Comparison |
|------------|----------|----------------------|
| 95th - 99th+ | Very High | Top 1-5% |
| 75th - 95th | Above Average | Upper quartile |
| 25th - 75th | Average Range | Middle 50% |
| 5th - 25th | Below Average | Lower quartile |
| <5th | Very Low | Bottom 5% |

## Advantages Over Z-Scores

- **Intuitive**: Easier for non-technical audiences to understand
- **No distribution assumptions**: Works with non-normal distributions
- **Directly comparable**: "You're in the top 10%" is clear

## Example

Your omega-3 index is at the **82nd percentile**:
- 82% of people in the reference population have lower levels
- 18% have higher levels
- You're in the "above average" range

## Converting Between Percentile and Z-Score

For normally distributed data:

| Z-Score | Percentile |
|---------|-----------|
| -2.0 | 2.3rd |
| -1.0 | 15.9th |
| 0.0 | 50th |
| +1.0 | 84.1st |
| +2.0 | 97.7th |

## Important Considerations

**Higher isn't always better**:
- 95th percentile vitamin D = Generally positive
- 95th percentile mercury = Concerning

**Reference population matters**:
- Athletic population vs. general population
- Age-matched vs. all adults
- Regional variations

**Percentiles vs. Clinical Cutoffs**:
- 25th percentile doesn't mean "deficient"
- Clinical ranges may use different thresholds than statistical percentiles

## Use in Wellness Reports

Percentiles are ideal for:
- **Nutritional status** (vitamins, minerals, fatty acids)
- **Performance metrics** (VO2 max, muscle mass)
- **Comparative tracking** (your progress vs. population)

Less useful for:
- **Binary outcomes** (presence/absence of condition)
- **Diagnostic cutoffs** (use clinical reference ranges instead)

## Related Concepts

- [Z-Score](z-score.md) - Statistical alternative using standard deviations
- Interquartile range (IQR) - The middle 50% (25th to 75th percentile)
