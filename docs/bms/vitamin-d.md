## Vitamin D (25-Hydroxyvitamin D)
# Overview
25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is the major circulating form of vitamin D and the best indicator of vitamin D status. It reflects both dietary intake and skin synthesis from sun exposure.
# Reference Ranges

Note: Optimal ranges may vary based on individual health conditions
# Functions
Vitamin D plays crucial roles in:

Bone health: Calcium absorption and bone mineralization
Immune function: Modulation of immune responses
Muscle function: Muscle strength and coordination
Cardiovascular health: Blood pressure regulation
Mood: Association with depression and seasonal affective disorder

# Factors Affecting Levels
Increase vitamin D:

Sun exposure (UVB radiation)
Dietary intake (fatty fish, fortified foods)
Supplementation
Summer season

Decrease vitamin D:

Limited sun exposure
Dark skin pigmentation
Aging (reduced skin synthesis)
Obesity (sequestration in fat tissue)
Malabsorption disorders
Chronic kidney disease

## Clinical Significance
# Low Levels May Indicate:

Inadequate sun exposure or dietary intake
Malabsorption (Crohn's, celiac disease)
Chronic kidney disease
Liver disease
Certain medications (anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids)

# High Levels May Indicate:

Excessive supplementation
Granulomatous diseases (sarcoidosis)
Some lymphomas

# Optimization Strategies
Sun exposure:

10-30 minutes midday sun, several times per week
Expose arms and legs without sunscreen
Duration depends on skin tone and latitude

# Dietary sources:

Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines): 400-1,000 IU per serving
Fortified foods (milk, cereals, orange juice): 100-400 IU per serving
Egg yolks: ~50 IU per egg
Mushrooms exposed to UV light: varies

Supplementation:

General maintenance: 1,000-2,000 IU/day
Deficiency correction: 5,000-10,000 IU/day (under supervision)
Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) preferred over D2

# Testing Recommendations

Initial screening: All adults, especially those with risk factors
Retest timing: 3-6 months after intervention
Optimal testing season: Late winter (lowest levels) or year-round baseline
