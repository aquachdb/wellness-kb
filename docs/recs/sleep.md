# Sleep Recommendations

## Overview

Sleep is a fundamental pillar of health that profoundly impacts biomarkers across multiple systems. Quality sleep regulates metabolism, immune function, hormone production, inflammation, cardiovascular health, and cognitive performance.

## General Guidelines

### Duration

| Age Group | Recommended Hours | Acceptable Range |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Adults (18-64) | 7-9 hours | 6-10 hours |
| Older Adults (65+) | 7-8 hours | 5-9 hours |

**Note**: Individual needs vary. Optimal duration is when you wake feeling refreshed without an alarm.

### Quality Markers

**Good sleep quality includes**:
- Fall asleep within 15-20 minutes
- Stay asleep through the night (or brief awakenings only)
- Wake feeling refreshed
- Consistent sleep/wake schedule
- Adequate time in deep and REM sleep

## Sleep Architecture

### Sleep Stages

**Non-REM Sleep**:
- **Stage 1** (5%): Light sleep transition
- **Stage 2** (45%): Light sleep, temperature drops
- **Stage 3** (25%): Deep/slow-wave sleep - physical restoration

**REM Sleep** (25%): 
- Rapid eye movement
- Dreaming, memory consolidation
- Cognitive restoration

**Healthy pattern**: 4-6 complete cycles per night (90-110 min each)

## Impact on Biomarkers

### Metabolic Health

**Poor sleep affects**:
- **Glucose metabolism**: Reduced insulin sensitivity
- **HbA1c**: Elevated with chronic sleep deprivation
- **Leptin/Ghrelin**: Appetite dysregulation (increased hunger)
- **Weight**: Increased cortisol and cravings

**Evidence**: Even one night of poor sleep reduces insulin sensitivity by 20-30%

### Hormones

**Sleep deprivation impacts**:
- **Cortisol**: Elevated, especially evening levels
- **Testosterone**: Reduced (primarily produced during sleep)
- **Growth hormone**: Mostly secreted during deep sleep
- **Thyroid**: Can affect TSH and thyroid hormones

### Inflammation

**Poor sleep increases**:
- C-reactive protein (CRP)
- Interleukin-6 (IL-6)
- TNF-alpha
- Overall inflammatory state

### Cardiovascular

**Chronic poor sleep linked to**:
- Elevated blood pressure
- Increased resting heart rate
- Reduced heart rate variability (HRV)
- Higher cardiovascular disease risk

### Immune Function

**Sleep supports**:
- T-cell function and antibody production
- Cytokine production
- Vaccine response
- Infection resistance

## Sleep Optimization Strategies

### Timing and Consistency

**Circadian alignment**:
- Go to bed and wake at same time daily (±30 min)
- Includes weekends (avoid "social jet lag")
- Natural wake time without alarm is ideal

**Optimal sleep window**:
- Most adults: 10 PM - 6 AM or 11 PM - 7 AM
- Align with natural circadian rhythm (early or late chronotype)

### Light Exposure

**Morning**:
- Bright light within 30-60 min of waking
- Sunlight ideal (10-30 min outdoors)
- Helps set circadian clock

**Evening**:
- Dim lights 2-3 hours before bed
- Avoid blue light (screens) 1-2 hours before bed
- Use blue light filters if screens necessary
- Blackout curtains or eye mask for bedroom

### Temperature

**Optimal bedroom**: 60-67°F (15.5-19.5°C)

**Core body temperature**: Must drop to initiate sleep
- Hot bath/shower 1-2 hours before bed (paradoxically helps)
- Cool bedroom with warm extremities (socks if needed)
- Avoid overheating (bedding, sleepwear)

### Food and Drink Timing

**Avoid**:
- Large meals 2-3 hours before bed
- Spicy or fatty foods at dinner (heartburn risk)
- Excessive fluids close to bedtime (nocturia)

**Caffeine**:
- Half-life: 5-6 hours
- Avoid after 2 PM (or 8-10 hours before bed)
- Individual sensitivity varies

**Alcohol**:
- Disrupts sleep architecture (less REM and deep sleep)
- Increases awakenings in second half of night
- Limit or avoid, especially close to bedtime

**Sleep-supportive foods**:
- Tryptophan-rich: Turkey, eggs, dairy, nuts
- Magnesium: Leafy greens, pumpkin seeds, almonds
- Complex carbohydrates: May facilitate tryptophan uptake
- Light snack if truly hungry (avoid going to bed very hungry)

### Evening Routine

**Wind-down protocol (60-90 min before bed)**:
1. Dim lights throughout home
2. Avoid stimulating activities (work, intense exercise, arguments)
3. Relaxing activities: Reading, stretching, meditation
4. Lower thermostat
5. Prepare bedroom (dark, cool, quiet)

**Avoid**:
- Screens (phones, tablets, TV, computers)
- Stressful conversations or news
- Intense exercise (within 2-3 hours)
- Bright overhead lights

### Bedroom Environment

**Optimize for sleep**:
- **Dark**: Blackout curtains, remove electronics with lights
- **Quiet**: White noise machine if needed, earplugs
- **Cool**: 60-67°F optimal
- **Comfortable**: Quality mattress, pillows appropriate for sleep position
- **Clean**: Allergen-free (wash bedding weekly)
- **Sleep-only**: Condition bedroom for sleep (avoid work/TV in bed)

### Physical Activity

**Exercise and sleep**:
- Regular exercise improves sleep quality
- Timing matters: Morning or afternoon ideal
- Avoid vigorous exercise 2-3 hours before bed
- Light stretching or yoga in evening is beneficial

## Biomarker-Specific Sleep Strategies

### High Cortisol
- Prioritize 8+ hours
- Strict sleep schedule
- Evening relaxation practices
- Consider adaptogenic herbs (with healthcare provider)

### Poor Glucose Control
- Consistent sleep duration (7-8 hours minimum)
- Avoid late-night eating
- Monitor continuous glucose if available (see sleep impact)

### Low Testosterone (Men)
- Prioritize 7-9 hours (testosterone produced during sleep)
- Address sleep apnea if suspected
- Improve sleep quality (deep sleep particularly important)

### Elevated Inflammation
- Increase sleep duration if <7 hours
- Focus on sleep quality (reduce awakenings)
- Address sleep disorders (apnea, insomnia)

### Poor HRV
- Consistent sleep schedule
- Adequate duration
- Avoid alcohol before bed
- Manage stress

## Sleep Disorders

### When to Seek Help

**Red flags**:
- Loud snoring with breathing pauses (sleep apnea)
- Inability to fall asleep despite opportunity (chronic insomnia)
- Excessive daytime sleepiness
- Restless legs or periodic limb movements
- Persistent early morning awakening (depression sign)

**Common disorders**:
- **Sleep apnea**: Breathing interruptions during sleep
- **Insomnia**: Difficulty falling or staying asleep
- **Restless leg syndrome**: Uncomfortable sensations in legs
- **Circadian rhythm disorders**: Delayed or advanced sleep phase

**Diagnostic tools**:
- Sleep study (polysomnography)
- Home sleep apnea test
- Sleep diary and actigraphy

## Sleep Tracking

**Methods**:
- **Wearables**: Track duration, stages, HRV (Apple Watch, WHOOP, Oura Ring)
- **Sleep diary**: Subjective quality and patterns
- **Apps**: Sleep Cycle, Sleep as Android

**Useful metrics**:
- Total sleep time
- Sleep efficiency (time asleep / time in bed)
- Time in each stage (if available)
- Awakenings
- Heart rate variability (HRV)
- Resting heart rate

**Caution**: Don't become overly focused on metrics (orthosomnia). Subjective quality matters most.

## Special Situations

### Shift Work
- Keep sleep schedule as consistent as possible
- Use blackout curtains for daytime sleep
- Strategic caffeine use (avoid 6 hours before sleep)
- Consider melatonin (with healthcare provider)

### Travel and Jet Lag
- Adjust sleep schedule before travel (gradually shift)
- Light exposure at destination (morning if traveling east, evening if west)
- Stay hydrated
- Consider melatonin for first few nights

### Stress and Anxiety
- Evening relaxation practices (meditation, breathing)
- Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)
- Address underlying stressors
- Avoid rumination in bed (get up if unable to sleep after 20 min)

## Supplements for Sleep (Consult Healthcare Provider)

**Evidence-supported**:
- **Magnesium** (glycinate): 200-400 mg, supports relaxation
- **Melatonin**: 0.5-5 mg, 30-60 min before bed (lower doses often effective)
- **L-theanine**: 200-400 mg, promotes relaxation
- **Glycine**: 3g before bed, may improve sleep quality

**Herbs** (limited evidence, consult provider):
- Valerian root, chamomile, passionflower, lavender

**Avoid long-term use without medical guidance**
