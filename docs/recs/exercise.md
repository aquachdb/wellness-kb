# Exercise Recommendations

## Overview

Regular physical activity is one of the most powerful interventions for improving healthspan and biomarker profiles. Exercise influences cardiovascular health, metabolic function, inflammation, body composition, and mental well-being.

## General Guidelines

### Minimum Recommendations (WHO/CDC)

**Aerobic Activity**:
- **150 minutes** moderate-intensity OR
- **75 minutes** vigorous-intensity per week
- Spread throughout the week (not all at once)

**Muscle Strengthening**:
- **2+ days per week**
- All major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, chest, abdomen, shoulders, arms)

**Additional Benefits**: More than minimum provides additional health benefits

### Optimal Weekly Structure
Monday: Strength training (45 min)

Tuesday: Moderate cardio (30 min)

Wednesday: Flexibility/mobility (20 min)

Thursday: Strength training (45 min)

Friday: High-intensity intervals (20 min)

Saturday: Active recovery or longer cardio (45-60 min)

Sunday: Rest or gentle movement (yoga, walking)

## Exercise Types and Benefits

### Aerobic (Cardio)

**Examples**: Walking, running, cycling, swimming, dancing

**Biomarker effects**:
- Improves cardiovascular markers (resting heart rate, blood pressure)
- Enhances insulin sensitivity
- Increases HDL cholesterol
- Reduces triglycerides
- Lowers inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6)

**Intensity guidelines**:
- **Moderate**: Can talk but not sing (50-70% max heart rate)
- **Vigorous**: Can only speak a few words (70-85% max heart rate)

### Strength Training (Resistance)

**Examples**: Weights, resistance bands, bodyweight exercises, machines

**Biomarker effects**:
- Increases muscle mass and bone density
- Improves glucose metabolism (HOMA-IR)
- Raises basal metabolic rate
- Reduces sarcopenia risk
- Improves testosterone/growth hormone (acute response)

**Recommendations**:
- 8-12 repetitions per set
- 2-4 sets per exercise
- 8-10 exercises covering major muscle groups
- Progress load gradually

### High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)

**Examples**: Sprint intervals, cycling intervals, circuit training

**Biomarker effects**:
- Improves VO2 max efficiently
- Enhances mitochondrial function
- Improves insulin sensitivity
- Time-efficient compared to steady-state cardio

**Structure**:
- Short bursts (20 sec - 4 min) at 80-95% max effort
- Recovery periods between intervals
- Total workout: 15-30 minutes
- 2-3x per week maximum (high recovery demand)

### Flexibility and Mobility

**Examples**: Yoga, stretching, tai chi, foam rolling

**Benefits**:
- Maintains range of motion
- Reduces injury risk
- Supports recovery
- Stress reduction (cortisol management)

**Recommendations**:
- Daily if possible, minimum 2-3x per week
- Hold stretches 15-60 seconds
- Focus on major muscle groups and problem areas

## Personalized Recommendations Based on Biomarkers

### High Glucose/HbA1c
- **Priority**: Aerobic exercise + resistance training
- **Timing**: Exercise after meals (30-60 min post-meal)
- **Frequency**: Daily if possible, minimum 5x/week
- **Why**: Improves insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake

### Elevated Inflammatory Markers (CRP, IL-6)
- **Priority**: Moderate aerobic exercise
- **Caution**: Avoid overtraining (increases inflammation)
- **Recovery**: Essential; include rest days
- **Why**: Moderate exercise is anti-inflammatory

### Low Vitamin D
- **Addition**: Outdoor exercise for sun exposure
- **Timing**: Midday when UVB strongest (with appropriate precautions)
- **Duration**: 15-30 minutes, 2-3x/week
- **Why**: Skin synthesis of vitamin D

### High Cortisol
- **Priority**: Moderate-intensity exercise, yoga, walking
- **Caution**: Avoid excessive high-intensity training
- **Addition**: Mind-body practices (tai chi, qigong)
- **Why**: Prevents cortisol elevation from overtraining

### Low HDL Cholesterol
- **Priority**: Vigorous aerobic exercise
- **Frequency**: 3-5x/week, 30+ minutes
- **Why**: Vigorous exercise most effectively raises HDL

### High Blood Pressure
- **Priority**: Aerobic exercise (walking, cycling, swimming)
- **Additions**: Resistance training (lighter weights, higher reps)
- **Caution**: Avoid heavy lifting without medical clearance; avoid Valsalva maneuver
- **Why**: Regular aerobic exercise lowers blood pressure

## Special Populations

### Beginners
- Start with 10-15 minutes daily
- Focus on building habit before intensity
- Walking is ideal starting point
- Add strength training after 2-4 weeks of cardio

### Older Adults (65+)
- Include balance exercises (fall prevention)
- Prioritize strength training (prevent sarcopenia)
- Moderate intensity generally sufficient
- Consider group classes for social benefits

### Athletes/Very Active Individuals
- Monitor for overtraining (elevated resting heart rate, poor sleep)
- Periodize training (vary intensity throughout year)
- Adequate recovery is critical
- Consider HRV monitoring

## Exercise Timing Considerations

### Morning
- **Pros**: Consistency (fewer scheduling conflicts), boosts energy, may improve insulin sensitivity all day
- **Cons**: May need longer warmup, cortisol already elevated

### Afternoon/Early Evening
- **Pros**: Peak body temperature (better performance), greater strength and power output
- **Cons**: Scheduling challenges, may affect sleep if too late

### Post-Meal
- **Pros**: Improves glucose disposal, reduces post-meal glucose spike
- **Ideal**: 30-60 minutes after eating

### Fasted vs. Fed
- **Fasted**: May enhance fat oxidation, not necessary for most people
- **Fed**: Better performance for high-intensity workouts
- **Recommendation**: Personal preference; performance matters most

## Tracking and Progression

**Key metrics**:
- Resting heart rate (measure upon waking)
- Workout heart rate and recovery
- Strength gains (weight/reps)
- Performance benchmarks (time, distance)
- Subjective: Energy, mood, sleep quality

**Progressive overload**:
- Gradually increase volume (duration, frequency)
- Increase intensity (speed, resistance)
- Improve technique and range of motion
- Add variety to prevent plateau

## Common Barriers and Solutions

| Barrier | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "No time" | Start with 10 min; high-intensity for efficiency |
| "No gym access" | Bodyweight exercises; walking/running outdoors |
| "Injuries/pain" | Low-impact options; water exercise; physical therapy |
| "Lack of motivation" | Group classes; workout partner; track progress |
| "Boredom" | Vary activities; try new sports; outdoor adventure |

## When to Consult a Professional

- History of cardiovascular disease
- Uncontrolled high blood pressure
- Persistent pain or injury
- New to exercise after 50
- Pregnancy
- Significant biomarker abnormalities
