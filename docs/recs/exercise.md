Exercise Recommendations
Overview
Regular physical activity is one of the most powerful interventions for optimizing biomarkers, preventing chronic disease, and enhancing overall wellness. Exercise affects cardiovascular health, metabolic function, immune response, and mental wellbeing.
Evidence-Based Guidelines
Aerobic Exercise
Minimum (American Heart Association/WHO):

Moderate intensity: 150-300 minutes per week

OR


Vigorous intensity: 75-150 minutes per week

OR


Equivalent combination of both

Optimal for most biomarkers:

200-300 minutes moderate intensity per week
Distributed across 4-6 days

Intensity definitions:

Moderate: Can talk but not sing (60-70% max heart rate)
Vigorous: Can only speak a few words (70-85% max heart rate)

Resistance Training
Minimum:

2 days per week
All major muscle groups
8-12 repetitions per set

Optimal:

2-4 days per week
2-3 sets per muscle group
Progressive overload principle
48-hour recovery between same muscle groups

Flexibility & Balance

Stretching: 2-3 days per week, all major muscle groups
Balance training: 2-3 days per week (especially age 65+)
Yoga, tai chi, or dedicated balance exercises

Biomarker-Specific Benefits
Cardiovascular Markers
Improves: Blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, resting heart rate
Exercise type: Aerobic (running, cycling, swimming)
Recommendation: 150+ min/week moderate-vigorous aerobic
Metabolic Markers
Improves: Fasting glucose, HbA1c, insulin sensitivity, body composition
Exercise type: Combination of aerobic + resistance
Recommendation:

150+ min/week aerobic
2-3 days/week resistance
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) especially effective

Inflammatory Markers
Improves: hs-CRP, IL-6, TNF-Î±
Exercise type: Moderate aerobic (intense exercise may temporarily increase)
Recommendation: Consistent moderate exercise, avoid overtraining
Vitamin D
Improves: Indirectly through outdoor activity and sun exposure
Recommendation: Outdoor exercise when possible
Hormone Balance
Improves: Testosterone, growth hormone, cortisol regulation
Exercise type: Resistance training + HIIT
Caution: Excessive endurance training may decrease testosterone
Sample Weekly Exercise Plans
Beginner (Sedentary to Active)

Monday: 20 min brisk walk
Tuesday: Bodyweight exercises (15 min)
Wednesday: Rest or gentle yoga
Thursday: 20 min brisk walk
Friday: Bodyweight exercises (15 min)
Weekend: 30 min recreational activity (hiking, cycling)

Total: ~120 minutes
Intermediate (General Health)

Monday: 30 min moderate cardio + 20 min full-body strength
Tuesday: 45 min brisk walk or jog
Wednesday: 30 min yoga or stretching
Thursday: 30 min moderate cardio + 20 min full-body strength
Friday: Rest or light activity
Saturday: 45-60 min recreational activity
Sunday: Rest or gentle movement

Total: ~200+ minutes
Advanced (Optimal Biomarkers)

Monday: 45 min HIIT cardio
Tuesday: 45 min upper body strength
Wednesday: 30 min moderate cardio
Thursday: 45 min lower body strength
Friday: 30 min HIIT or sport
Saturday: 60+ min long cardio or sport
Sunday: Active recovery (yoga, walk)

Total: ~300+ minutes
Exercise Intensity Monitoring
Heart rate zones:

Zone 1 (50-60% max): Very light, warm-up
Zone 2 (60-70% max): Light, fat-burning, can hold conversation
Zone 3 (70-80% max): Moderate, somewhat difficult to talk
Zone 4 (80-90% max): Hard, can only speak few words
Zone 5 (90-100% max): Maximum, unsustainable for long

Max heart rate estimate: 220 - age
RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) can substitute:

1-3: Light
4-6: Moderate
7-8: Vigorous
9-10: Maximum

Special Considerations
For Specific Conditions:
Cardiovascular disease:

Medical clearance required
Start low intensity, progress slowly
Avoid maximal exertion

Diabetes:

Exercise improves insulin sensitivity
Monitor blood glucose before/after
Carry fast-acting carbs

Autoimmune conditions:

Moderate exercise beneficial
Avoid overtraining (can worsen inflammation)
Listen to body during flares

Pregnancy:

Continue exercise if previously active
Avoid contact sports, supine position after 1st trimester
Focus on pelvic floor exercises

Avoiding Overtraining
Warning signs:

Persistent fatigue, poor sleep
Elevated resting heart rate
Decreased performance
Frequent illness
Mood disturbances, irritability
Elevated inflammatory markers

Prevention:

Progressive overload (increase 10% per week max)
Rest days are essential
Periodization (vary intensity)
Adequate sleep and nutrition

Getting Started
Action steps:

Assess current level: How active are you now?
Set realistic goals: Start where you are
Schedule it: Treat exercise like an appointment
Track progress: Use apps, wearables, or journal
Find enjoyment: Choose activities you like
Social support: Exercise with others when possible
Professional guidance: Consider trainer or physical therapist

Remember: Some exercise is always better than none. Start small and build consistency.
